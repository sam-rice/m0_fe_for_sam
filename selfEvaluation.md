# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I'm reasonably confident with understanding the basic function of `for` statements.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had some productive struggling while completing the practice exercises at the end of the For Statements lesson. I didn't get through all of them, but researching different ways of solving them and experimenting with different methods was really effective at building up my understanding.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to figure out how to manipulate/analyze parts of strings within arrays like the challenges referenced above. I plan to do the rest of the exercises over the weekend or sooner, if an opportunity presents itself or someone else in the cohort workshops it on Slack.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

See above. I will try online independent research first, then I might resort to bringing it to my group. (I already brought up one of the challenges as my technical challenge post)
